# Description

This repo contains all the base files necessary to start building a custom WordPress theme. Each file contains basic code and comments to explain what the code does and why.

I made this repo essentially so I wouldn't have to rewatch tutorials and re-read the WP codex and handbook every time I make a theme.

# Using the Repo

1. Download the files (maintaining the directory structure and filenames)
2. Delete or customize .gitignore and README.me
3. Customize the files as necessary
  1. Files in the css and js directories can be renamed
4. When done, upload to your WP site and activate the theme
5. ???
6. Profit
